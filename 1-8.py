# assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is  a
# substring of another. Given two string, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2
# is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring (e.g. waterbottle is a rotation of erbottlewat)


waterbottle + waterbottle = waterbottlewaterbottle
then check if erbottlewat is substring of waterbottlewaterbottle
